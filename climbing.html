                Trekking in Seattle can be easily differentiated into three different levels such as low, medium and hard
                and if you are in Seattle you can experience all three different forms of Hikes based on the terrain. Mt. Rainier 
                is one of the famous attractions of Seattle. In winter and all around the year people climb Mt. Rainier in
                freezing snow. Other mountains that exist are Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams, Mt. Baker, Mt. Olympus, Mt. Si.

                People are ready for every weather to hike. There are many small peaks such as Goat mountains that are medium
                dificulty level hike but are beautiful as it gives a panoramic view to mountains such has Rainier,Helen and 
                Adams. The hike itself is serene as we pass through few lakes along the hike.
